## Instructions

-   Each problem has an associated Ballerina package template, and you must use that template to write your solution.

-   Example inputs and outputs are listed in each problem description, and Ballerina test cases are available for each example in the provided package template.

-   Please follow the [Get Started with Ballerina Guide](https://ballerina.io/learn/get-started-with-ballerina/?utm_source=HackerE&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=HackerE_link_SepHackathon_220812) to set up Ballerina for local development.

-   Test your solution by running \"bal test\" from the package root directory.

-   You are welcome to test your solution by adding more test cases. However, we will not use your test cases to try out the submitted solution.

-   Alternatively, you can use the "Run code" button in the web IDE to run the sample tests.

-   Once you are confident with your solution, use the "Submit code" button in the web IDE to submit your solution. You can continue to resubmit until your submission obtains a satisfactory score.

##Important!

The built-in web IDE of the HackerEarth platform has limited support for Ballerina, thus we recommend you [set up Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/learn/get-started-with-ballerina/?utm_source=HackerE&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=HackerE_link_SepHackathon_220812) locally.
You can download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the[ Ballerina VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.ballerina) from
the marketplace. For each problem, you can download the package folder locally, implement the solution, test it, and then copy your solution into the web IDE in HackerEarth for submission. To download the problem folder from the online IDE: right-click on the main folder and select download.

**Before you work on hackathon questions locally** run this command to
use the correct Ballerina version:

bal dist pull 2201.2.0
